Feature: Check /etc/hosts has been restored and lock file removed by general cleanup

  Scenario: Check remote machine is back to initial state
    # Check /etc/hosts file is restored
    Given I open a ssh connection to '${ES_NODE}' with user 'root' and password 'stratio'
    When I run 'cat /etc/hosts' in the ssh connection
    Then the command output does not contain '3.3.3.3   bdt3.stratio.com'
    # Check backup and lock file have been removed
    When I run 'ls -al /etc | grep hosts' in the ssh connection
    Then the command output does not contain 'hosts.bdt'
    And the command output does not contain 'hosts.lock.'
